* Assume that the maintainers and readers of the code you write are frontend (HTML/JS/CSS) experts:
   * Don't use comments to explain the obvious.
   * Use self-explanatory variable and function names.
   * Use short variable names when the context is clear.
* Always add minimal possible code to make the changes requested.
* Do not remove exsiting empty lines, do not reformat existing lines if not necessary, do not remove existing comments.
